  /** The `Show` typeclass gives us a static guarantee that it makes sense
    * to convert a type to a String. This is not always true for any given type,
    * but the `toString` method that all types get from `Any` lets this happen.
    * For instance, should we be able to `toString` a `Future`? You can:

    * {{{
    * scala> Future(println("hi")).toString
    * res3: String = Future(<not completed>)hi
    * }}}
    *
    * How about a function?
    *
    * {{{
    * scala> val f: Int => Int = { n => n + 1 }
    * f: Int => Int = $$Lambda$1035/114275379@765e9352
    *
    * scala> f.toString
    * res0: String = $$Lambda$1035/114275379@765e9352
    * }}}
    *
    * Notice that the following also works:
    *
    * {{{
    * scala> val stuff: List[Any] = List(1, true, "Hi")
    * stuff: List[Any] = List(1, true, Hi)
    *
    * scala> stuff.map(_.toString)
    * res1: List[String] = List(1, true, Hi)
    * }}}
    *
    * How was it able to find the correct `.toString` for each element, even though
    * they've all been cast to `Any`? The answer is a dynamic method lookup at runtime
    * (i.e. runtime polymorphism), which would incur some overhead and is generally
    * antithetical to type-safety.
    *
    * `Show` binds "printability" to a typeclass, making the conversion call
    * (via `shows`) a static one instead of a runtime reflective one as with `toString`.
    * Only types that are strictly _data_ will ever have a `Show` instance.
    *
    * All the standard types have `Show` instances defined for them already.

    * Javascript) guarantees that the type on each side of the operator is the same.
    *
    * `Equal` is also useful as it paves the way for the `Order` typeclass,
