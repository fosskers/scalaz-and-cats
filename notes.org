** Preface

ScalaZ and Cats are libraries which provide Functional Programming constructs
for Scala (i.e. ~Monad~ n' friends).

This repository is a comparison of these two libraries by someone who isn't predisposed
to either one. If you're a contributor to either library and notice a discrepancy here,
please let me know!

We seek to answer the following question:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Should I use ScalaZ or Cats?
#+END_QUOTE

The answer is, of course, "it depends". What's your use-case?

** Use Cases

*** I want to train my Scala team in Functional Programming fundamentals

[[https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala][Functional Programming in Scala]], by Runar Bjarnson and Paul Chiusano, is a valuable
book for learning about Functional Programming in general. Otherwise, both ScalaZ and Cats have
specific books and professional training available.

ScalaZ:

- [[https://leanpub.com/fpmortals][Functional Programming for Mortals]] by Sam Halliday (for FP beginners - assumes an OO Scala background)
- Training by the [[http://fantasyland.institute/][Fantasyland Institute]]

Cats:

- [[https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/][Scala with Cats]] by Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell (assumes 1+ years of Scala experience)
- Training by [[https://underscore.io/training/courses/advanced-scala/][Underscore Consultants]]

*** I'm writing a performance-sensitive application

Lean toward Cats, it tends to be faster in aggregate. Are you using a
database? Consider [[https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie][Doobie]], which uses Cats.

*** I want to improve quality-of-life for my Scala devs

Any dedicated application of FP concepts will help you organize and simplify
your code. Libraries like [[https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum][simulacrum]], [[https://github.com/bkirwi/decline][decline]] and [[https://github.com/circe/circe][circe]] can provide immediate wins
by drastically cutting down boilerplate. The latter two can be used natively with Cats,
or via ScalaZ with the [[https://github.com/djspiewak/shims][shims]] library.

*** I'm writing a library/application that works with a complex DSL

You probably need Recursion Schemes, which are supplied by the [[https://github.com/slamdata/matryoshka][Matryoshka]]
library in ScalaZ-land.

*** I want to port a well-known, general-purpose Haskell library to Scala

You'd be a champ to write a backend for both ScalaZ and Cats, but
know that Cats has a head start and has a nice set of ported libraries
already.

*** I care about licensing

ScalaZ is BSD3, while Cats is MIT + BSD3, since it derived from ScalaZ originally.

*** I care about which stays truer to Haskell

ScalaZ does. Its core has a larger API, provides more features up-front,
and tends to keep Haskell function names and operators (e.g. ~<*>~).

*** I care about which has more industry backing

[[https://www.jetbrains.com/research/devecosystem-2017/scala/][According to this survey]], ScalaZ does.

*** I hear the ~IO~ Monad can help me logically organize my code

Both ScalaZ 7 and Cats have a ~effects~ subpackage which provides an
~IO~ type. They both help you contain "real world" side-effects into
smaller areas of your code base, freeing the rest of it to purity
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency][referential transparency]]). They also help you wrangle IO-based
Exceptions.

Cats' ~IO~ is currently faster in aggregate. However, an overhaul
of ~scalaz-effects~ with many orders of magnitude of improvement in
performance is promised [[http://degoes.net/articles/scalaz8-is-the-future][for ScalaZ 8]], so you may want to wait
for that if IO is a great concern to you.

*** Futures suck and I hate JVM thread pools. Help?

[[http://degoes.net/articles/scalaz8-is-the-future][Wait for ScalaZ 8.]]

*** Just gimme Monads

Then either is fine, you can flip a coin.

*** I'm interested in other FP options on the JVM

If you're not already entrenched in Scala, then you're in luck.
[[http://eta-lang.org/][Eta]] is a Haskell dialect that targets the JVM. It can access a large
portion of the existing Haskell library ecosystem, and also has a [[http://eta-lang.org/docs/html/eta-tutorials.html#interacting-with-java][Java FFI]]
that handles the possibility of ~null~ more explicitely than Scala.

An example:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  -- | Type-safe import of a Java method that is null-safe.
  foreign import java unsafe "@static java.lang.System.getenv"
    getEnv :: String -> IO (Maybe String)

  -- | Checks the environment for the HOME environment
  -- variable and prints it out if it exists.
  main :: IO ()
  main = do
    home <- getEnv "HOME"
    case home of
      Just homePath ->
        putStrLn $ "Your home directory is " ++ homePath ++ "!"
      Nothing ->
        putStrLn "Your HOME environment variable is not set"
#+END_SRC

Things like typeclasses and the ~IO~ Monad are first-class concepts, so no extra
library like ScalaZ or Cats is necessary. Eta supports unsigned integer types (called ~Word~
in Eta/Haskell and sometimes ~uint~ elsewhere) which neither Java nor Scala have natively.
[[https://github.com/Jyothsnasrinivas/eta-spark-core][Eta also has bindings to Apache Spark.]]

If you're already in Scala-land but want to integrate Eta or gradually migrate
to it, [[https://blog.eta-lang.org/integrating-eta-into-your-scala-projects-a8d494a2c5b0][there exists an sbt plugin for Eta<->Scala integration.]]

** Benchmarks

Benchmarks were performed using the [[https://github.com/ktoso/sbt-jmh][JMH plugin for SBT]].
Vanilla Scala and Haskell results are also included where applicable.

*** Results

/All times are in nanoseconds. [[https://github.com/milessabin/kittens][Kittens]] and [[https://gitlab.com/fommil/scalaz-deriving/][scalaz-deriving]] were used to derive Eq instances./

/Notes:/

- ~Eq~ benchmarks for ScalaZ employ its ~IList~ type, not vanilla ~List~
- ~Show~ for ScalaZ and Cats behaves differently. ScalaZ's prefixes and affixes
  quotation marks, so that Strings can be copy-pasted between editor and REPL.
  This is what Haskell's ~Show~ does as well. Cats does not do this, so it can
  "return early" in the case of ~String~.

*** Observations

- *Type-safe equality checking is on-par or faster than Vanilla Scala.* So, there seems
  to be no reason not to use ~Eq.===~ in all cases.
- At the small scale (i.e. a single ~>>=~), ScalaZ tends to be faster.
- At aggregate scale, Cats tends to be faster.
- Neither library performs well on recursive Monadic operations. Haskell is two to
  three orders of magnitude faster in this regard. In particular, GHC heavily optimizes
  both ~IO~ and ~State~ operations.

*** Caveat

As of this writing (2017 November), ScalaZ 8 is still under development but promises
significant performance improvements for their ~IO~ Monad. The benchmarks above
will have to be reran when it is released.

** Usage Considerations

*** API Accessibility

Up front, Cats has much more documentation and usage examples. Their website is
good for this. However, given that they both have blog posts and books written about
them, overall the availability of resources should be about equal between the
two libraries.

The Cats import story is consistent - for most tasks you only need:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  import cats._            /* To refer to top-level symbols like Monad */
  import cats.implicits._  /* To get typeclass instances and operators */
#+END_SRC

ScalaZ has a bit more flexibility with their imports, but honestly you can
just avoid that and do:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  import scalaz._
  import Scalaz._
#+END_SRC

and you'll get all data types, typeclasses, instances, and operators.
If you're willing to do that, then the import experience for both libraries
is the same.

*** Features

**** ScalaZ: ~IList~

From its Scaladocs:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Safe, invariant alternative to stdlib ~List~. Most methods on ~List~ have a sensible
equivalent here, either on the ~IList~ interface itself or via typeclass instances
(which are the same as those defined for stdlib ~List~). All methods are total and stack-safe.
#+END_QUOTE

Between being invariant and avoiding connection to Scala's enormous Collections API,
~IList~ manages to be the fastest general-purpose Scala container type to iterate over.
Specifically, it handles tail-recursive algorithms with pattern matching
(thus mimicking ~.map~ and ~.foldLeft~) twice as fast as vanilla ~List~.
Only an ~Array~ of ~Int~ or ~Double~ via a ~while~ loop can iterate faster.

**** ScalaZ: ~Maybe~

From its Scaladocs:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
~Maybe[A]~ is isomorphic to ~Option[A]~, however there are some differences between the two.
~Maybe~ is invariant in ~A~ while ~Option~ is covariant. ~Maybe[A]~ does not expose an unsafe
get operation to access the underlying ~A~ value (that may not exist) like ~Option[A]~ does.
~Maybe[A]~ does not come with an implicit conversion to ~Iterable[A]~ (a trait with over
a dozen super types).
#+END_QUOTE

The implication is that ~Maybe~ should be safer and slightly more performant than ~Option~.
Ironically, many ScalaZ methods that yield an "optional" value use ~Option~ and not ~Maybe~.

Where Monad Transformers and concerned, ScalaZ provides both ~MaybeT~ and ~OptionT~.

**** ScalaZ: ~EphemeralStream~

From its Scaladocs:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Like ~scala.collection.immutable.Stream~, but doesn't save computed values. As such,
it can be used to represent similar things, but without the space leak problem
frequently encountered using that type.
#+END_QUOTE

The dream of lazy Haskell lists realized? Maybe. With ~EphemeralStream~ (or ~EStream~
as the cool kids call it), even the "head" value is lazy. So one would use ~EStream~
when there's no guarantee that even the first value might be used.

How does it perform?

/All times are in microseconds./

| Benchmark      | List | IList | Vector | Array |         Stream | EphemeralStream | Iterator |
|----------------+------+-------+--------+-------+----------------+-----------------+----------|
| ~foldLeft~     | 33.3 |  31.3 |   68.9 |  56.4 |           56.9 | 163.1           |     55.4 |
| ~foldRight~    | 69.2 |  89.5 | 228.39 |  55.1 | Stack Overflow | Stack Overflow  |    147.6 |
| Tail Recursion | 45.9 |  24.1 |        |       |           69.8 |                 |          |

We see similar slowdowns for chained higher-order ops as well. Looks like building in
the laziness has its cost.

*** Typeclasses

Typeclasses are a powerful programming construct to relate data types that have
common behaviour. They describe /how/ a type should behave, as opposed to what
a data type /is/ (re: Object Oriented programming).

Both ScalaZ and Cats provide the "standard" typeclasses, namely ~Monoid~, ~Functor~,
~Applicative~, and ~Monad~, as well as a wealth of others for more specialized work.
In general, the ScalaZ typeclass hierarchy is larger than the Cats' one.

**** Custom Typeclasses

Scala doesn't yet have first-class support for typeclasses. While it's very possible
to create trait/object structures that represent a typeclass, there is no built-in
syntax for it. The library [[https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum][simulacrum]] helps greatly with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  package mylib

  import simulacrum._

  @typeclass trait Semigroup[A] {
    @op("<>") def combine(x: A, y: A): A
  }
#+END_SRC

This /significantly/ reduces boilerplate. At compile time, this tiny definition
is expanded into everything necessary to use ~.combine~ (or its optional operator ~<>~!)
as an injected method on your ~A~ type. Here's how to write an instance:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  case class Pair(n: Int, m: Int)

  object Pair {
    implicit val pairSemi: Semigroup[Pair] = new Semigroup[Pair] {
      def combine(x: Pair, y: Pair): Pair = Pair(x.n + y.n, x.m + y.m)
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

This way, whenever ~Pair~ is in scope, its ~Semigroup~ instance will also be
automatically visible. Defining the ~Semigroup[Pair]~ somewhere else makes it
an /Orphan Instance/, which runs the risk of burdening your users with
confusing imports.

Now extend some top-level package object of yours like:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  package object mylib extends Semigroup.ToSemigroupOps
#+END_SRC

And then full use of your typeclass is just one import away!
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  import mylib._

  scala> Pair(1, 2) <> Pair(3, 4)
  res0: Pair = Pair(4, 6)
#+END_SRC

**** Instance Derivation

In Haskell, automatic typeclass instance derivation is frequent:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  -- The usuals - many more can be derived.
  data User = User { age  :: Int
                   , name :: Text
                   } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, NFData, Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON)
#+END_SRC

Fortunately, both ScalaZ and Cats provide a similar mechanism. Nobody wants to
write boilerplate!

[[https://gitlab.com/fommil/scalaz-deriving/][scalaz-deriving]] exposes the ~@deriving~ macro for ScalaZ typeclasses:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  @deriving(Equal, Show, Encoder, Decoder)
  case class User(age: Int, name: String)
#+END_SRC

Where ~Encoder~ and ~Decoder~ are from ~play.json~.

[[https://github.com/milessabin/kittens][Kittens]] provides shapeless-based "semi-auto" derivation for Cats:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  case class User(age: Int, name: String)

  object User {
    implicit val userEq: Eq[User] = cats.derive.eq[User]
    implicit val userShow: Show[User] = cats.derive.show[User]
  }
#+END_SRC

Which requires more typing, but has more features, like auto-derivation of
[[https://github.com/milessabin/kittens/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/derive.scala][higher-kinded things]] like ~Functor~.

For Circe ~Encoder~ and ~Decoder~ instances specifically, the following was
already possible:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  import io.circe.generic.JsonCodec

  @JsonCodec
  case class User(age: Int, name: String)
#+END_SRC

**** Caveat

With the current form of the Scala language and compiler, typeclasses have limitations
in both performance and correctness.
The details are described in the recent paper [[https://adelbertc.github.io/publications/typeclasses-scala17.pdf][The Limitations of Type Classes as Subtyped Implicits]],
by Adelbert Chang.

If this concerns you, there are [[http://eta-lang.org/][safer options]] for FP on the JVM.

*** Monadic Recursion

If you're not careful, Monadic Recursion with ScalaZ can blow the JVM stack.
For instance, the following will "just work" with Cats:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def countdown: State[Int, Int] = State.get.flatMap { n =>
    if (n <= 0) State.pure(n) else State.set(n - 1) *> countdown
  }
#+END_SRC

Which in ScalaZ would blow the stack for ~n~ greater than a few thousand.
The proper ScalaZ equivalent is:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def trampolineCountdown: StateT[Trampoline, Int, Int] = State.get.lift[Trampoline].flatMap{ n =>
    if (n <= 0) StateT(_ => Trampoline.done((n,n)))
    else State.put(n - 1).lift[Trampoline] >> trampolineCountdown
  }
#+END_SRC

~Trampoline~ seems like an implementation detail, but it's exposed to the user here.

A quote from Cats:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Because monadic recursion is so common in functional programming but is not stack
safe on the JVM, Cats has chosen to require ~tailRecM~ of all monad
implementations as opposed to just a subset.
#+END_QUOTE

So ~tailRecM~ gets us stack safety - if you can figure out how to implement it
correctly. I tried for ~Tree~ and was not successful.

John de Goes on ScalaZ 8:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
~tailRecM~ will not be a function on Monad, because not all monads can implement it in constant stack space.
#+END_QUOTE

So ScalaZ chooses lawfulness over convenience in this case.

** Library Health and Ecosystems

*** Project Pulses

As of 2017 November 6.

| Project | Releases | Watchers | Stars | Forks | Commits | Prev. Month Commits | ScalaJS | Scala Native |
|---------+----------+----------+-------+-------+---------+---------------------+---------+--------------|
| ScalaZ  |      106 |      257 |  3312 |   534 |    6101 |                  45 | Yes     | Yes          |
| Cats    |       22 |      174 |  2118 |   493 |    3280 |                  51 | Yes     | *No*         |

ScalaZ's numbers are higher, but that's to be expected as it's an older project.
Otherwise the projects seem to be about equally active.
Notably missing is the lack of Scala Native support in Cats.

*** Sub-libraries

The diagram below looks one-sided, but must be taken with a grain of salt. As projects,
Cats and ScalaZ have different aims. Cats has a small, tight core and espouses modularity.
ScalaZ frames itself as a batteries-included standard library for FP in Scala. ScalaZ
certainly has a larger and more featureful API than Cats at current. This will
be increasingly true for the up-coming ScalaZ 8, which aims to provide the equivalent
functionality of Dogs, Monocle, and Matryoshka directly. It also plans to provide
low-level concurrency primitives which see no analogue in Cats or Vanilla Scala.

That in mind, here is a simplified view of their library ecosystems:

[[./ecosystem.png]]

/Notes:/

- Origami is a port of Haskell's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl][foldl]] library
- Atto is a port of Haskell's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec][attoparsec]] library
- Decline and optparse-applicative are ports of Haskell's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative][optparse-applicative]] library
- Refined is a port of Haskell's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/refined][refined]] library
- Monocle is a port of Haskell's [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens][lens]] library

**** Shims

Libraries like ~circe~, ~atto~ and ~decline~ are immense standard-of-living
improvements for Scala developers. Luckily, the [[https://github.com/djspiewak/shims][shims library]] allows us
to use them via ScalaZ, too. Likewise, Matryoshka becomes usable
via Cats. From the ~shims~ project:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Shims aims to provide a convenient, bidirectional, and transparent set of conversions
between scalaz and cats, covering typeclasses (e.g. ~Monad~) and data types (e.g. ~\/~).
By that I mean, with shims, anything that has a ~cats.Functor~ instance also has a ~scalaz.Functor~
instance, and vice versa.
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://github.com/fosskers/shimmy][Here is a working example:]]

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  package shimmy

  import scalaz._
  import Scalaz._
  import shims._
  import com.monovore.decline._  /* Depends on Cats */

  object Shimmy extends CommandApp(
    name = "shimmy",
    header = "Demonstrate how shims works.",
    main = {
      /* These are `decline` data types with `Applicative` instances from Cats */
      val foo = Opts.option[String]("foo", help = "Foo")
      val bar = Opts.option[Int]("bar", help = "Bar")
      val baz = Opts.flag("baz", help = "Baz").orFalse

      /* These are ScalaZ operators that use ScalaZ's `Applicative` */
      (foo |@| bar |@| baz) { (_, _, _) => println("It worked!") }
    }
  )
#+END_SRC

** Resources

The tendency is for Cats to have better documentation and examples up-front, while
ScalaZ has an extensive ~examples~ subpackage.
